                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                <p>
                    Look, getting into Cognizant isn't rocket science. Thousands of freshers crack it every year. The key is consistent preparation and not taking it lightly just because it's an "easy" company to get into.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Start preparing at least 1-2 months before your campus drive. Solve problems daily, work on your communication skills, and most importantly � be genuine in your interview.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cognizant is a great place to start your career. Good work-life balance, decent pay, lots of learning opportunities, and a huge employee base means you'll never feel alone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>All the best for your Cognizant journey!</strong>
