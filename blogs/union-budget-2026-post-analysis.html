                    <p><strong>It is done. The budget is out. Now what?</strong></p>
                    <p>I have spent the last 48 hours glued to my screen - watching expert panels, reading reports,
                        checking stock prices, and talking to people who actually understand this stuff. And honestly?
                        This budget is... complicated.</p>
                    <p>Some people are celebrating, some are disappointed, and most are just confused about what it
                        actually means for them. So I have put together this massive breakdown covering everything that
                        happened AFTER the budget was announced - the market reactions, expert opinions, who won, who
                        lost, and what you should actually do now.</p>
                    <p>Grab a chai. This is going to be detailed.</p>
                    <h2>Market Reaction - How Did Dalal Street Respond?</h2>
                    <p>Let us start with what everyone was watching - the stock market. Within minutes of FM Nirmala
                        Sitharaman finishing her speech, the market gave its verdict.</p>
                    <p><strong>Market Stats on Budget Day:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Sensex (Close):</strong> +1.2%</li>
                        <li><strong>Nifty 50:</strong> +1.35%</li>
                        <li><strong>Bank Nifty:</strong> +2.8%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The initial reaction was positive, which honestly surprised some analysts. Here is the thing -
                        markets do not just react to what is in the budget. They react to what they <em>expected</em>
                        versus what they <em>got</em>.</p>
                    <p>The market was pricing in a fiscal deficit of around 4.8-5%. When FM announced 4.5%, that was
                        seen as fiscally responsible. Add to that the income tax relief for the middle class, and you
                        have got a recipe for green candles.</p>
                    <h3>Sector-wise Winners</h3>
                    <h4>Banking & Financial Services</h4>
                    <p>Lower taxes mean more disposable income. More disposable income means more spending, more loans,
                        more deposits. Banks were the clear winners on budget day with most banking stocks up 2-4%.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact: Positive</strong></p>
                    <h4>Infrastructure & Construction</h4>
                    <p>Rs 15 lakh crore capital expenditure allocation! That is a massive jump. Companies in roads,
                        railways, and construction are looking at a busy few years ahead.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact: Strongly Positive</strong></p>
                    <h4>Renewable Energy & EV</h4>
                    <p>The government's push for green energy continues. Extended tax benefits for EV manufacturers and
                        solar panel incentives mean this sector is going to grow fast.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact: Positive</strong></p>
                    <h4>IT & Semiconductors</h4>
                    <p>Rs 10,000 crore for semiconductor manufacturing and AI research. While this is long-term, it
                        signals the government is serious about making India a tech hub.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact: Long-term Positive</strong></p>
                    <h3>Sector-wise Losers</h3>
                    <h4>Cigarettes & Tobacco</h4>
                    <p>Sin tax increased again. Cigarette prices going up by Rs 2-5 per pack. ITC took a hit on budget
                        day, though it recovered somewhat.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact: Negative</strong></p>
                    <h4>Imported Electronics</h4>
                    <p>Custom duties on certain imported electronic components increased. This might affect smartphone
                        prices in the short term.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact: Mixed</strong></p>
                    <h4>Real Estate (Luxury Segment)</h4>
                    <p>No major sops for the luxury real estate segment. The affordable housing push continues, but
                        premium property developers did not get what they hoped for.</p>
                    <p><strong>Impact: Neutral</strong></p>
                    <h2>What Are The Experts Saying?</h2>
                    <p>I have compiled reactions from some of the biggest names in finance and economics. Here is what
                        they are saying:</p>
                    <blockquote>"This is a balanced budget that addresses the concerns of the middle class while
                        maintaining fiscal discipline. The focus on infrastructure spending will have a multiplier
                        effect on the economy." - Senior Economist, Leading Investment Bank</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>"The income tax changes are welcome, but let us be honest - the real relief comes from
                        the increased Section 80C limit. That is what will actually put more money in people's pockets
                        through savings." - Tax Expert, Chartered Accountant & Author</blockquote>
                    <blockquote>"For startups, this budget is a mixed bag. The extended tax holiday is great, but we
                        were hoping for more clarity on angel tax and ESOP taxation. The intent is right, execution
                        needs work." - Startup Founder, Bangalore-based Unicorn</blockquote>
                    <h2>The Real Winners & Losers - Let Us Be Honest</h2>
                    <h3>WINNERS</h3>

                            25,000-50,000 annually is real and significant.</li>
                        <li><strong>First-time Homebuyers:</strong> Extended interest deduction benefits and affordable
                            housing push.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h3>LOSERS</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Super Rich (Rs 1Cr+ Income):</strong> No relief in surcharge. Still paying the
                            highest effective rate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Crypto Investors:</strong> No clarity on crypto taxation. Status quo continues.</li>

                        <li><strong>Luxury Car Buyers:</strong> Import duties remain high.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h2>What Happens Next? The Timeline</h2>

                    </ul>
                    <h2>What Should YOU Do Now?</h2>
                    <p>Alright, enough analysis. Let us talk about action. Here is what I would suggest based on your
                        situation:</p>

                    <h3>If You Are a Salaried Employee:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compare both tax regimes</strong> - The new regime is more attractive now, but run
                            the numbers for YOUR specific situation</li>
                        <li><strong>Max out Section 80C</strong> - The new Rs 2 lakh limit is your best friend for tax
                            saving</li>
                        <li><strong>Update your investment declaration</strong> with HR before April to optimize TDS
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Consider NPS contributions</strong> - Additional Rs 50,000 deduction under 80CCD(1B)
                            still applies</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>If You Are a Business Owner:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Review your tax structure</strong> - Consult a CA about the new presumptive taxation
                            limits</li>
                        <li><strong>Check sector-specific incentives</strong> - Manufacturing, green energy, exports
                            have specific benefits</li>
                        <li><strong>Plan capital expenditure</strong> - Infrastructure push means opportunity for B2B
                            businesses</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>If You Are an Investor:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Do not make knee-jerk reactions</strong> - Budget day volatility is real, wait for
                            dust to settle</li>
                        <li><strong>Look at beneficiary sectors</strong> - Infrastructure, banking, green energy for
                            long-term</li>
                        <li><strong>ELSS deadline</strong> - Still a great tax-saving option with potential returns</li>
                    </ul>
                    <blockquote>
                        <strong>Quick Action Items:</strong><br>
                        1. Calculate your tax under both old and new regimes (use online calculators)<br>
                        2. Review your insurance, especially health insurance limits<br>
                        3. Check if your employer has updated salary structure for new standard deduction<br>
                        4. Start SIP if you have not - ELSS funds are great for tax + wealth creation<br>
                        5. Book a session with a tax consultant before March end

                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                    <p>Look, no budget is perfect. This one has its hits and misses. But here is my honest take:</p>
                    <p><strong>For the average Indian earning Rs 8-20 LPA, this is a good budget.</strong> You are
                        getting real tax relief, not just on paper. The focus on infrastructure means jobs. The push for
                        manufacturing means the economy is trying to create sustainable growth.</p>
                    <p>Is it revolutionary? No. Is it populist before elections? Maybe a little. But is it fiscally
                        irresponsible? Definitely not. The government managed to give relief while keeping the fiscal
                        deficit in check.</p>
                    <p>The real test will be implementation. India has a history of great policies with poor execution.
                        Let us hope this time is different.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stay updated, stay informed.</strong></p>
