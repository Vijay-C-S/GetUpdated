            <div class="article-content">
                <p class="lead">Apple has officially unveiled the AirTag 2, marking the first major upgrade to its popular item tracker since the original launched five years ago in 2021. The new AirTag features enhanced range, a louder speaker, and improved Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology.</p>

                <h2>What's New in AirTag 2</h2>
                <p>The second-generation AirTag comes packed with significant improvements that address many of the common complaints from users of the original version:</p>

                <h3>Enhanced UWB Chip</h3>
                <p>The new AirTag 2 features Apple's latest Ultra-Wideband chip, providing significantly better range and precision when locating lost items. Users can now find their belongings from much greater distances, and the Precision Finding feature works more accurately than ever before.</p>

                <h3>Louder Speaker</h3>
                <p>One of the most requested features has finally arrived – a louder speaker. The original AirTag's speaker was often criticized for being too quiet, especially when trying to locate items in noisy environments or when the tracker was hidden inside bags. The new speaker promises to be significantly louder while maintaining the same compact size.</p>

                <h3>Improved Battery Life</h3>
                <p>Apple claims the new AirTag 2 offers improved battery efficiency, meaning users won't need to replace the CR2032 battery as frequently. The company estimates roughly 18 months of use under normal conditions.</p>

                <h2>Privacy and Anti-Stalking Features</h2>
                <p>Apple has also enhanced the anti-stalking measures in the AirTag 2:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Faster unwanted tracking alerts on both iOS and Android devices</li>
                    <li>More prominent audio alerts when an unknown AirTag is traveling with you</li>
                    <li>Improved integration with the Find My network for law enforcement cooperation</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Pricing and Availability</h2>
                <p>The AirTag 2 is priced at $29 for a single unit and $99 for a pack of four, matching the original AirTag's pricing. Pre-orders begin today, with units shipping within 2-3 weeks.</p>

                <h2>Competition Heats Up</h2>
                <p>The AirTag 2 launch comes as competition in the Bluetooth tracker market intensifies. Alternatives like the Pebblebee Clip 5, which works with both Apple's Find My and Google's Find Hub networks, offer cross-platform functionality that Apple's solution lacks.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The AirTag 2 represents our continued commitment to helping people keep track of what matters most. With improved range and a louder speaker, finding your lost items has never been easier." - Apple spokesperson
                </blockquote>

                <h2>Should You Upgrade?</h2>
                <p>For current AirTag users, the upgrade decision depends on your needs. If you've struggled with range limitations or have had trouble hearing your AirTag, the new model is worth considering. However, if your current AirTags work well for your use cases, the original version remains perfectly functional.</p>
