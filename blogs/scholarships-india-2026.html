                    <h2>🏛 Government Scholarships - The OG Free Money</h2>

                    <p>
                        Let's start with government scholarships because honestly, these are the most reliable ones. No
                        shady terms and conditions, proper disbursement (well, mostly 😅), and huge coverage.
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. National Scholarship Portal (NSP) - The Big Daddy</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you haven't heard of NSP yet, where have you been?! This is literally the one-stop-shop for
                        most central and state scholarships. I remember spending hours on this portal during my college
                        days. Here's what you can apply for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Post-Matric Scholarship for SC/ST/OBC</strong> - Get up to ₹10,000 every year</li>
                        <li><strong>Central Sector Scholarship</strong> - ₹10,000-20,000/year for graduation & PG</li>
                        <li><strong>AICTE Pragati</strong> - ₹50,000/year for girls in engineering (yes, fifty
                            thousand!)</li>
                        <li><strong>AICTE Saksham</strong> - ₹50,000/year for differently-abled students</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>🔗 Direct link:</strong> <a href="https://scholarships.gov.in" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">scholarships.gov.in</a> (keep refreshing if it's slow, pretty normal 😂)</p>

                    <h3>2. Goa CM Scholarship Portal</h3>
                    <p>
                        Good news for my Goan friends! Your state government has some solid scholarship schemes through
                        the CM Scholarship Portal.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Who can apply:</strong> Students domiciled in Goa</li>
                        <li><strong>What you get:</strong> Varies by scheme - but worth checking out</li>
                        <li><strong>Last date:</strong> <span style="color: #ef4444; font-weight: 600;">February 28,
                                2026</span> - still time!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>3. Banishree Scholarship - Odisha</h3>
                    <p>
                        This one's specifically for students with disabilities from Odisha. Really appreciate that the
                        government has dedicated schemes like these.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> 40%+ disability certificate from Odisha</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Tuition fees + maintenance allowance</li>
                        <li><strong>Deadline:</strong> <span style="color: #ef4444; font-weight: 600;">February 15,
                                2026</span> - hurry up!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="tip-box">
                        <h4><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Real Talk</h4>
                        <p>
                            Always, ALWAYS apply through official .gov.in websites only. I've seen so many fake
                            scholarship sites asking for "processing fees" - that's a scam! Legit scholarships are 100%
                            FREE to apply.
                        </p>

                    <h2>🏢 Corporate Scholarships - When Companies Give Back</h2>

                    <p>
                        Okay, here's where it gets interesting. Big Indian companies offer some seriously generous
                        scholarships. And honestly? Less people know about these, so your competition is lower. Smart
                        move applying here!
                    </p>

                    <h3>1. JSW Udaan Scholarship</h3>
                    <p>
                        JSW Group's scholarship program is pretty solid. They're giving away up to ₹50,000 per year -
                        that's a lot of help with your fees!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ambani family's contribution to education, I must say. This one's quite competitive, but the
                        rewards are worth the effort.

                            Start at least 2-3 months early because you'll need IELTS/TOEFL scores, SOPs, recommendation
                            letters - trust me, it takes time.

                    <h2>📝 My Personal Tips for Getting Scholarships</h2>

                    <p>
                        Okay, real talk time. I've applied for scholarships myself and helped a bunch of friends too.
                        Here's what actually works:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Get your documents ready BEFORE you need them:</strong> Income certificate takes
                            forever at the Tahsildar office. Go get it now!</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't wait for the last day:</strong> Websites crash, servers go down, your internet
                            dies - Murphy's Law is real 😤</li>
                        <li><strong>Triple-check your application:</strong> One wrong digit in your Aadhaar = rejection.
                            Not kidding.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your SOP matters more than you think:</strong> For competitive scholarships, they
                            want to know YOUR story. Don't copy-paste from the internet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make a spreadsheet:</strong> Track all your applications with deadlines. Future you
                            will thank you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Follow up politely:</strong> If you don't hear back after the expected date, one
                            polite email doesn't hurt.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="info-box">
                        <h4>Documents You'll Need (Almost Always)</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Aadhaar Card (both sides)</li>
                            <li>Income Certificate (fresh one from Tahsildar)</li>
                            <li>Caste Certificate (if applicable)</li>
                            <li>Bank Account Details (ideally in YOUR name)</li>
                            <li>Previous Year Marksheets (keep scanned copies ready)</li>
                            <li>Current Enrollment/Bonafide Certificate</li>

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                    <h3>Q: Can I apply for multiple scholarships at once?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Short answer: YES!</strong> There's no rule against applying to multiple scholarships.
                        But here's the catch - if you GET one government scholarship, you usually can't hold another
                        government one simultaneously. Private scholarships are generally more flexible. My advice?
                        Apply to as many as you're eligible for. Worst case, you'll have to choose - and that's a good
                        problem to have! 😉
                    </p>

                    <h3>Q: Is there an age limit for scholarships?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Depends on the scholarship. Most UG scholarships want you under 25-30 years. PG scholarships are
                        usually more relaxed - up to 35 in many cases. Always check the specific criteria before wasting
                        time on an application you're not eligible for.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Q: Do I need to repay scholarships later?</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Nope!</strong> Scholarships are NOT loans. You don't pay back a single rupee. That's the
                        whole point! However, some scholarships have conditions like maintaining a minimum CGPA or
                        completing your degree within the stipulated time. Read the terms carefully.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Q: How can I increase my chances of getting selected?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Honestly? There's no magic formula. But here's what helps: good academics (obviously), genuine
                        extracurriculars (not resume padding), a compelling personal story in your SOP, and applying
                        EARLY. Also, apply to multiple scholarships - it's a numbers game sometimes.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

                    <p>
                        Look, I get it. The whole scholarship hunting process can feel exhausting. You're already
                        dealing with studies, maybe entrance exams, and now THIS. But think about it - a few hours of
                        effort now could save you lakhs of rupees. That's a pretty good ROI, right?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong>Education should never be limited by money.</strong> And with so many scholarships
                        available in India today, it doesn't have to be. So stop procrastinating (I'm looking at you
                        👀), bookmark this page, set those deadline reminders, and start applying!
